HOW TO TEST:

Android:
1. Open UserSide app
2. Go to Report Crime
3. Click blue "Use my current location" button
4. Grant location permission
5. Wait for GPS lock (2-3 seconds)
6. Address + coordinates should appear
7. Submit report

iOS:
1. Same as Android
2. Permission prompt says: "AlertDavao needs your location..."
3. Accept and proceed

Web:
1. Click "Use my current location"
2. Browser prompts for location
3. Grant permission
4. Location retrieved from browser geolocation API

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Error: "Location services are not available"
→ Enable location in device settings

Error: "Location permission was denied"  
→ Allow location in app permissions

Error: "Location request timed out"
→ Check internet connection and GPS signal
→ Try near a window

BACKEND INTEGRATION:
